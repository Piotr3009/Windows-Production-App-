# Calculation Overview

The calculation engine derives sash and glazing dimensions using fixed deductions that mirror the production spreadsheet.

## Frame and Sash
- Sash width deduction: 178 mm
- Sash height deduction: 106 mm
- Frame components use historic liner deductions for accuracy

## Configurations
Supported grids: 2×2, 3×3, 4×4, 6×6, 9×9, and custom up to 12×12.

Glazing bar positions divide the available width/height into equal segments based on the number of bars. Pane sizes subtract the glazing bar width and a 3 mm tolerance per pane.

## Shopping List
Linear timber requirements include a 15% waste factor. Glass entries list every pane with the chosen glazing type. Hardware and finish options come from form selections.
